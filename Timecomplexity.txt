Time complexity of MergeSort is O(n log n)
For large datasets, Merge Sort outperforms linear-time sorting algorithms like Insertion 
Sort and Bubble Sort in terms of speed. Nevertheless, the expense of merging procedures 
and recursive calls may outweigh the efficiency of competing algorithms, 
such as Quick Sort or Heap Sort, for small datasets.
